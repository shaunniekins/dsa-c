Pseudocode and short descriptions for various tree traversal techniques:

1. Pre-order Traversal:

Pseudocode:

```
function preOrderTraversal(node)
    if node is not null
        visit(node)
        preOrderTraversal(node.left)
        preOrderTraversal(node.right)
```

Description:
Pre-order traversal is a depth-first tree traversal technique that visits the root node, then recursively traverses the left subtree, and finally the right subtree. It is often used to create a copy of the tree or evaluate expressions in expression trees.

2. In-order Traversal:

Pseudocode:

```
function inOrderTraversal(node)
    if node is not null
        inOrderTraversal(node.left)
        visit(node)
        inOrderTraversal(node.right)
```

Description:
In-order traversal is a depth-first tree traversal technique that recursively traverses the left subtree, visits the root node, and then recursively traverses the right subtree. It is commonly used to visit nodes in sorted order in a binary search tree.

3. Post-order Traversal:

Pseudocode:

```
function postOrderTraversal(node)
    if node is not null
        postOrderTraversal(node.left)
        postOrderTraversal(node.right)
        visit(node)
```

Description:
Post-order traversal is a depth-first tree traversal technique that recursively traverses the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally visits the root node. It is often used to delete nodes in a tree or perform certain computations.

4. Level-order Traversal (Breadth-First):

Pseudocode:

```
function levelOrderTraversal(root)
    queue = createEmptyQueue()
    enqueue(queue, root)
    while queue is not empty
        node = dequeue(queue)
        visit(node)
        enqueue(queue, node.left)
        enqueue(queue, node.right)
```

Description:
Level-order traversal is a breadth-first tree traversal technique that explores nodes level by level. It uses a queue to maintain the order. It is often used for tasks such as finding the shortest path in a tree or graph, and for printing the tree in a structured way.

These traversal techniques are fundamental for navigating and processing binary trees and other tree-like data structures.
